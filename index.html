         <p>Hi, Am Rex, an adorable brown German Sherperd dog that has a few black spots spread across my body and tail 
             and I also have fluffy velvety ears</p>
         <h2>About Rex</h2>
         <p><strong>Rex</strong> loves lots of things. Among them is to nuzzle his wet nose in my hands and in the hands on my friends and 
             siblings. He craves attention most of the time because he is scared of being abandoned or ignored. I adopted
             Rex while he was still a <em>puppy</em>. It appears his owner had abandoned him on the road. I found him wandering in our neighborhood and 
              decided to take care of him . I knew there and then that we would have a wonderful relationship. 
              could allow us to adopt the pet.</p>
